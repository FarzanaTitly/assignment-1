                It’s easy to drift. Life is hectic for all of us and if we’re not intentional about our direction in
                life we can
                easily wake up one day and wonder how we got where we are. You sit down at your computer, determined to
                be
                productive. The next thing you know, it’s been twelve hours.</p><br>
